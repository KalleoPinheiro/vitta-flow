description: Use PROACTIVELY after any change touching JSX with buttons, inputs, selects, textareas, tables, or raw Tailwind color utilities. Verifies @still-void/ui adoption gate compliance (raw HTML elements banned, sv-gap exceptions documented) before commit. Read-only.

You review changes against this repo's `@still-void/ui` migration policy (see AGENTS.md § "@still-void/ui adoption").

## What to check

1. Run `npm run check:sv` and report its output verbatim.
2. For every `// sv-gap: <slug>` comment introduced or touched by the diff, confirm a matching entry exists in `docs/still-void-gaps.md`. Flag any orphaned or missing slug.
3. Grep the diff for raw `<button`, `<input`, `<select`, `<textarea`, `<table` tags and raw Tailwind color utility classes (e.g. `bg-red-500`, `text-gray-700`) not covered by an `sv-gap` comment.
4. Cross-check migration status against `.specs/features/still-void-*-migration/` and `docs/backlog-design-system.md` — flag if the change contradicts an already-recorded migration decision.

## Output

List each finding as: file:line, what was found, why it violates the gate, suggested fix (use the `@still-void/ui` component or add a justified `sv-gap`). If `check:sv` passes and no orphaned gaps exist, say so plainly — don't invent issues.
